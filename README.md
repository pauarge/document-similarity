# document-similarity

This project implements Jaccard Similarity, Mihash Similarity and Locally Sensitive Hashing to detect and grade similarity between documents. 

This README is purely a howto guide to compile and execute the program. For more detailed information on the actual implementation, please refer to the docs/ folder. 

## Requirements

This project has been developed in C++, thus, a C++ compiler is required.

The Boost C++ library has also been used, therefore Boost must be installed on the system.

Finally, CMake is the system used to manage the building process, therefore it's also needed.
